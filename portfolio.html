        <p>Check out some of the projects I've worked on:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Drone-Driven Sag Detection: Aerial Analysis Of Wire Tension</li>
            <p>• By integrating advanced hardware components onto a drone platform, including high-resolution cameras, LiDAR sensors, and real-time data processing capabilities, the system aims to provide accurate and timely detection of sagging in structures. • Used IoT and Arduino to develop drone and components, etc.</p>
            <li>Python-Based Face Detection System: Enhancing Visual Recognition with Advanced Algorithms</li>
            <p>Utilizes advanced algorithms to locate human faces in images or video streams accurately. Implements computer vision techniques like Haar cascades or CNNs to detect facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>
        </ol>
